## Results

The project identifies several customer segments:

- **Loyal:** Customers who have subscribed recently, frequently, and for high monetary value (high frequency and monetary, low recency). Frequent subscription and good payment history, High average transaction value
- **Promissing:** Customers who have not subscribed recently, infrequently, and for low monetary value (medium frequency and monetary). Just started subscribing or not very often, but has the potential to become a regular customer. Has interest in the product but has not yet shown full commitment.
- **Need Attention:** Former high-value customers who have stopped purchasing (low frequency, low monetary, high recency). Low transaction frequency or tend to subscribe infrequently. Risk to churn or move to competitors

## Potential Marketing Strategies

- **Loyal:** Special rewards and benefits such as exclusive discounts, given points to be exchanged for attractive prizes, referral programs that when recommending services to others will get special rewards, feedback to evaluate aspects that can be improved, invite to special events, and given service offers that match their preferences or that they might like.
- **Promissing:** Send regular reminders and promotions to keep them interested in subscribing, Offer additional products or bundled packages that suit their needs, to increase long-term commitment, Offer free demos or trials for higher plans, so they can experience greater benefits.
- **Need Attention:** Make an effort to re-engage them by understanding their reasons for switching, Contact them personally to find out the reasons for their dissatisfaction or disinterest, Offer special discounts or comeback promos to entice them back to use the service, Provide packages that are more flexible or suited to their needs so that they do not feel burdened by costs or commitments, Send reminders about the service and the benefits they can get by continuing to use the product, Send a short survey to understand what may be unsatisfactory, and follow up on the results for improvement.
